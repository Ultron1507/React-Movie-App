# React Movie App

This is a fully functional movie and TV show app built using ReactJS, Redux, and the TMDb API. It features trending movies and TV shows that update daily, a search bar for finding specific content, and an infinite scroll for seamless browsing. The hero section displays a new image on each refresh for a dynamic user experience.
